WordPress User Mover
==================

This standalone web application connects directly to the database of two separate WordPress installs and transfers WP users between them.

Frontend interface is built with AngularJS and communicates with a backend powered by Symfony framework which provides custom API endpoints to manage the data transfer in configurable batches between the two WordPress installations.
